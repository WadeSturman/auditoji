# ðŸŽ§ Auditoji

**Auditoji** It's 2025, and we're still reading reminders? Auditoji is a sound-based reminder assistant that helps you stay on track using personalized audio cues. Build small habits with auditory conditioning...give those pretty eyes a rest.

## Features
- Open it up, set up recurring reminders, hear a fun sound, form a habit.
- Custom reminders with unique sounds
- Automatic keyword-to-sound mapping via `sound_library.json`
- Recurring reminders
- macOS notifications (Banner or Alert style)
- Terminal interface with no extra dependencies

## Why?
Written reminders are easy to ignore. Sounds are harder to tune out. Auditoji helps you train your brain with custom audio triggers â€” like emoji, but with vibes.

python auditoji.py
